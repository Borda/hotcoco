# hotcoco documentation style

hotcoco documentation follows the
[Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style),
with the deviations recorded at the end of this file. Google is the default; when
this file is silent, follow Google. When Google is silent, follow the
[Google word list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list) and then the
Chicago Manual of Style.

The choice was cross-shopped in 2026-08 against the alternatives — Microsoft,
Red Hat, GitLab, and the Diátaxis framework — and Google was reaffirmed. Don't
re-litigate it. Diátaxis is a structure framework, not a style guide; the
guide/API page split already follows its discipline, and no further adoption is
planned.

**Scope.** These rules govern published prose: `docs/`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
Rust `///` and `//!` doc comments, PyO3 `#[doc = "..."]` strings, Python docstrings,
`.pyi` stubs, CLI `help=` text, and user-facing warning and error messages. They do not
govern `//` and `#` implementation comments, which answer to the *why, not what* rule in
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (Code style) instead.

## Voice

Google supplies the mechanical rules; this section is the voice on top of them.

- **Python-first, data-scientist audience.** Doc comments on public API read like the
  Polars or numpy docs — plain English, example-driven, no Rust jargon in the prose.
  Type signatures handle that.
- **Plain, not promotional.** hotcoco is an open-source project, not a pitch. No
  taglines, no paired slogans, no sales rhetoric. The test for every sentence: you could
  say it to a colleague without wincing. State concrete facts in plain verbs — the
  register of the ruff and uv READMEs. The perception-toolkit framing stays; the sales
  voice does not.
- **Singular, confident tone.** Direct imperative: "Run `evaluate()` before calling
  this."
- **Lean prose.** Every sentence earns its place. No "It should be noted", no "This
  function".
- **Why, not what.** The signature shows what. The doc comment explains intent,
  tradeoffs, and non-obvious invariants.

For a voice-only pass on a file: fix prose in place, do not touch logic or structure,
and leave doc comments that are already good alone.

## Canonical homes

Every fact has exactly one page that owns it; every other surface links there instead of
restating it. Before writing a paragraph, check whether its owner already exists.

| Fact | Owner | Everyone else |
|---|---|---|
| Benchmark tables, timing numbers, parity figures | `docs/benchmarks.md` | README and index keep one headline number and a link |
| Provenance and `"extension"` semantics | `docs/guide/results.md` | one line and a link |
| camelCase alias table | `docs/getting-started/migration.md` | one note at the top of an API page, never per-method admonitions |
| `init_as_pycocotools()` usage | `docs/guide/frameworks.md` | a code snippet is fine in README and quickstart; explanation links |
| RLE `counts` bytes-to-str gotcha | `docs/guide/masks.md` | link |
| LVIS metric key set | `docs/guide/lvis-open-images.md` | link |
| Repo-checkout workflows (`just download-coco`, build from source, parity scripts) | `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the benchmarks "Reproducing" section | user-facing pages never include them |

**Guide pages** hold worked examples and interpretation; **API pages** hold signatures,
parameters, and return shapes. Never copy a return-shape table into a guide. The guide
splits three ways: the core pipeline in `docs/guide/evaluation.md`, LVIS and Open Images
protocols in `docs/guide/lvis-open-images.md`, and confusion, TIDE, calibration, and
comparison in `docs/guide/diagnostics.md`.

Admonitions flag genuine traps only. If the same admonition would appear twice on one
page, replace all of them with one note at the top.

## Rules

### Headings and titles

Sentence case. Capitalize the first word and proper nouns only.

```
# Mask operations          # Working with results          ## Format conversion
```

Acronyms and product names keep their capitalization: `# LVIS and Open Images`,
`## Ultralytics YOLO`, `### From the CLI`, `## What is RLE?`.

Nav labels in `zensical.toml` are titles too, and must match the page's H1.

Spell out `and` in headings and in bold bullet labels — never `&`. Product names are the
exception: `### Weights & Biases`, `W&B`.

Changing `&` to `and` **moves the heading's anchor**, because `&` slugifies to nothing.
Run `just docs-links` and repoint inbound links. Sentence-casing alone is anchor-safe;
the slugifier lowercases either way.

### Words to avoid

| Don't write | Write instead |
|---|---|
| `e.g.` | `for example`, `such as`, or recast the sentence |
| `i.e.` | `that is`, or recast |
| `etc.` | `and so on`, name the rest, or recast |
| `simply`, `easily`, `just`, `obviously`, `straightforward` | delete it |
| `please` | delete it |
| `allows you to`, `enables you to` | say what it does |
| `in order to` | `to` |
| `Note that` | delete it |
| `and/or` | name the combinations |
| `sanity check` | `confidence check`, `quick check` |
| `dummy` | `placeholder` |
| `abort` | `stop`, `cancel` |
| `blindly` | `without checking` |
| `we`, `our` | second person, or name the actor |

### may, might, can

Google splits three senses that English blurs:

- **`may`** — permission. `metrics` **may not** import a family driver. Correct, keep it.
- **`might`** — possibility. Some metrics **might** show `-1.000`.
- **`can`** — ability. These numbers **can** be compared against a leaderboard.

`you may need to` is almost always `you might need to`.

### Tense

Present tense. Describe what the software does, not what it will do.

- **No:** a 4-core laptop will see less
- **Yes:** a 4-core laptop sees less

### Spatial references

Never `above` or `below` to point at other content on a page — content reflows, and a
screen reader user has no "above." Use `preceding` / `following`, or link to the section
by name.

- **No:** see below · as shown below · the run above · see `image_id` issue above
- **Yes:** see [Verification](#verification) · the preceding run · the next section

`above` and `below` are fine for real comparisons: *scores below the threshold*, *anything
above ~1e-12*. They are also fine when describing actual on-screen layout: *the banner
above the KPI tiles*.

### Link text

Link text names the destination. Never `here`, `this`, `this link`, or `more`. Match the
target page's title so a renamed page is a visible, greppable break.

### Lists, tables, code

- Sentence case in table headers; no terminal punctuation in cells unless they hold full
  sentences.
- Serial (Oxford) comma.
- Every code fence carries a language tag: `python`, `bash`, `json`, `toml`.
- Numbered lists for ordered procedures; each step starts with an imperative verb.

### Error and warning messages

Lowercase, no trailing period, specific about what went wrong and what to do:
`iou_type must be one of: bbox, segm, keypoints`. The word rules above apply — a
message reading `lines may show -1.000` becomes `lines might show -1.000`.

A message string is often quoted verbatim in `docs/`. Change both in the same commit, and
check `cargo test` — some tests assert on message text.

## Deviations from Google

**Em dashes are spaced: ` — `, not `—`.** Google specifies no surrounding spaces. hotcoco
uses spaced em dashes throughout, deliberately: the docs are read as often in a terminal
and in raw Markdown as on the rendered site, and an unspaced em dash closes up the line in
monospace. This is the house style; do not "fix" it.

**`vs` is allowed inside code identifiers and short table cells** where `versus` would not
fit — `bytes vs string`. Use `versus` in prose.

**British spellings survive in shipped CHANGELOG entries.** `_typos.toml` sets
`locale = "en-us"`, and `typos` runs through pre-commit. Fix the spellings your change
introduces; leave released CHANGELOG text alone.

## Checking

No linter enforces this file — Vale was evaluated in 2026-03 and removed as too noisy for a
single-contributor repo. The checks that do run:

```bash
just docs-links                      # internal links, heading anchors, nav coverage
uv run pre-commit run typos --all-files  # spelling
cargo doc --no-deps 2>&1 | grep warning
```

Before finishing a docs change, grep your own diff for the words-to-avoid table. It takes a
minute and catches most of what this file is for.
