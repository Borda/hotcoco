# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to fix them.

## Import errors

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hotcoco'`

The package isn't installed in the active environment. Run:

```bash
pip install hotcoco
```

If you're in a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before installing.

---

### `ImportError` after upgrading numpy

hotcoco ships prebuilt wheels that bundle a compiled Rust extension. If you upgrade numpy to a major version that changes the C ABI (numpy 1.x → 2.x, for example), you might need to reinstall hotcoco to pick up a compatible wheel:

```bash
pip install --upgrade hotcoco
```

The `coco` CLI distinguishes this case: when the package is present but its
compiled extension fails to import (broken wheel, wrong platform), the error says
so and suggests reinstalling rather than claiming hotcoco is not installed.

---

### Name conflict with pycocotools

If you have both `hotcoco` and `pycocotools` installed and import `COCO` from `pycocotools` by accident:

```python
# Wrong — gets pycocotools
from pycocotools.coco import COCO

# Right — gets hotcoco
from hotcoco import COCO
```

To use hotcoco as a drop-in without changing any imports, call `init_as_pycocotools()` once at the start of your script — see [Framework integrations](../guide/frameworks.md) for the details and per-framework notes.

## Detection format errors

### `load_res` raises a `KeyError` or returns empty results

Your detection file is missing a required field. The fields each `iou_type` needs, with a minimal example, are in [Bounding box evaluation](../guide/evaluation.md#bounding-box-evaluation) and the segmentation and keypoint sections of the same page; if the boxes load but the numbers look wrong, check [Bbox format](#bbox-format-x1-y1-x2-y2-vs-x-y-w-h).

---

### Bbox format: `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` vs `[x, y, w, h]`

COCO uses `[x, y, width, height]` (top-left corner + size) in **pixel coordinates**. Two common pitfalls:

- Many model outputs use `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` (two corners) instead of `[x, y, w, h]`
- Some formats, such as YOLO, use normalized coordinates in `[0, 1]` — COCO always expects pixel values

Convert before passing to `load_res`:

```python
# Convert XYXY → XYWH
detections = [
    {**d, "bbox": [d["bbox"][0], d["bbox"][1],
                   d["bbox"][2] - d["bbox"][0],
                   d["bbox"][3] - d["bbox"][1]]}
    for d in raw_detections
]
```

---

### `image_id` not found in ground truth

If a detection's `image_id` doesn't exist in the ground-truth dataset, it won't raise an error — `load_res` accepts it, but the evaluator silently ignores it since there's no matching GT image to evaluate against. No warning is emitted, so mismatches can be hard to spot.

Verify your image IDs match:

```python
gt_img_ids = set(coco_gt.get_img_ids())
dt_img_ids = {d["image_id"] for d in detections}
missing = dt_img_ids - gt_img_ids
if missing:
    print(f"Detections reference {len(missing)} unknown image IDs: {list(missing)[:5]} ...")
```

---

## Segmentation issues

### RLE `counts` field: bytes vs string

`mask.encode` returns `counts` as `bytes`, and JSON cannot hold bytes — the conversion is in [RLE `counts` is bytes, not a string](../guide/masks.md#rle-counts-is-bytes-not-a-string).

---

### `size` field order: `[height, width]`

COCO RLE uses `[height, width]` order, not `[width, height]`. If your masks look wrong or you get shape mismatches, check that `size` matches the image dimensions in `[H, W]` order.

---

## Evaluation results

### Metrics differ slightly from pycocotools

First check that `ev.params` matches the configuration you expect — mismatched `iou_thrs` or `area_rng` is the usual cause. With default parameters, hotcoco matches pycocotools to the last bits of a `float64` (see [Benchmarks](../benchmarks.md#metric-parity)); anything above about 1e-12 is a bug worth reporting.

---

### `summarize()` prints `-1.000`

**Every metric is `-1.000`.** `evaluate()` found no matching (image_id, category_id) pairs between GT and DT. Common causes:

- Wrong `iou_type` — for example, passing segmentation results to `COCOeval(..., "bbox")`
- `category_id` mismatch — model uses 0-indexed classes but COCO uses 1-indexed IDs
- All detections were dropped by `load_res` — see [`image_id` not found in ground truth](#image_id-not-found-in-ground-truth)

Check that categories align:

```python
gt_cats = {c["id"]: c["name"] for c in coco_gt.load_cats(coco_gt.get_cat_ids())}
dt_cat_ids = {d["category_id"] for d in detections}
missing_cats = dt_cat_ids - set(gt_cats)
if missing_cats:
    print(f"Unknown category IDs in detections: {missing_cats}")
```

**Some metrics are `-1.000`.** You customized `iou_thrs`, `max_dets`, or `area_rng`, and the fixed 12-line display has no value for that slot — AP50 needs `0.50` in `ev.params.iou_thrs`, for example. This is expected; `ev.get_results()` returns only the metrics that were computed. See [`summarize`](../api/cocoeval.md#summarize).

---

### `tide_errors()` raises `RuntimeError`

`tide_errors()` needs `evaluate()` to have run first — see [`tide_errors`](../api/cocoeval.md#tide_errors).
