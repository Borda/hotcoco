//! `EvalReport` — the shape every family's results take.
//!
//! Detection produces one today; panoptic, tracking, concepts, and composed
//! metrics produce the same type as they land. A dashboard, a CLI renderer, or a
//! report writer consumes `EvalReport` without caring which family filled it in.
//!
//! # Provenance is enforced, not advisory
//!
//! [`Provenance`] records whether a number is a benchmark-standard result, a
//! labeled hotcoco extension, or something a user composed from primitives.
//! Family drivers set it, the Python constructor hardwires
//! [`Provenance::UserComposed`], and it survives serialization — so a report
//! cannot claim parity it was never checked for. Without it, composed and
//! extension numbers look exactly like leaderboard numbers once they reach a chart.
//!
//! # What belongs in `curves`
//!
//! Whatever a renderer needs to draw the result and cannot recompute (PR curves,
//! HOTA's alpha sweep, calibration bins) — an open string-keyed map so families
//! extend it without a breaking change. **Not** a dump of the full evaluation
//! arrays: detection's precision tensor is ~1M floats on COCO, and stays
//! reachable through the family's own types instead.
